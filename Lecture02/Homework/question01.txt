Requirement:
Create a list of integers which specify the length of each word in a certain 
sentence ("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"), but only if the word 
is not the word "the".

Note:
Use a list comprehension to implement it.

Sample Result:
['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']
[5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3]
