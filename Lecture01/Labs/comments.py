"""
Let's start some good habits today. Adding comment lines at regular intervals helps to
break up your code and make it easier to understand. Python does not enforce use of
white-space around operators (such as "=") but it really helps the reader. Please compare
the readability of these two code blocks:
"""

# One way to write the code
num=24
a=34.999
result=num*(13/a**2)+1.0
print("Result:",result)

# Another wa to write the code
# Set up calculation inputs
num = 24
a = 34.999

# Calculate result using the Godzilla algorithm
result = num * (13 / a**2) + 1.0
print("Result:", result)
